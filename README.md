# House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a regression model to predict house prices based on factors such as size, location, number of rooms, and year built. It helps in understanding property valuation and market trends.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Housing Price Dataset (or similar)
- **Features:** Square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, year built, etc.
- **Target:** `House Price`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features (e.g., location)
   - Scaling numerical data
2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
   - Identifying key predictors
3. **Model Training:**
   - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. **Evaluation:**
   - RMSE, MAE, R² Score

## 📈 Results
- The model provides accurate price predictions based on key property attributes.
- Feature importance analysis highlights the most influential factors in house pricing.
